This mod removes all trigger technologies from the game, reverting it back to an experience more like 1.1. This process is automatic, meaning it should be compatible with mods, but also means it has the chance to break. Let me know if any issues crop up, or if you have any features you wish to be added.

For technologies at the very start of the game that can be completed without research, their recipes are enabled from the start of the game. For technologies partway into the game (like oil extraction, uranium mining, Space Age planets, etc.) their recipes are added to the closest non-trigger technology. In vanilla, this means that uranium and crude oil operate like they did in 1.1, and recipes like the laboratory, circuits, and automation science are unlocked from the start. In Space Age, this means that each planet's trigger technologies are tied to the Discover Planet research.

If you have a mod idea, let me know and I can look into it.
